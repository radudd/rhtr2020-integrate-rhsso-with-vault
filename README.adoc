## About

This chart can be used to deploy Red Hat SSO

* Integration with CrunchyData Postgres
* Integration with Vault for fetching secrets like:
** admin credentials
** dynamic db secrets 
** user credentials for a minimalistic bootstrap
** client secrets for a minimalistic bootstrap
* For the seeding part a separate K8s job will be used. This will connect to Red Hat SSO API and will run the seeding
* Flag for enable/disable Vault integration. If Vault disabled, use Kubernetes secrets
* Use OpenShift CA signer for generating SSL certificates

## To Do before deployment

* Define Namespace

```
export NS=rhtr2020-rhsso-vault-crunchy
```

* Install Crunchy operator

```
helm install crunchy-operator helm/crunchy-operator 
```

* Install Crunchy instance

First generate some dummy config for PG Backrest

```
helm/crunchy/scripts/crunchy-ssh-generate.sh
```

Then deploy a Crunchy instance

```
helm install crunchy helm/crunchy 
```

* Configure Vault

** Enable database engine and dynamic secrets for Postgres

```
scripts/vault-configure-db.sh
```

** Enable kv2 engine and create policy and roles 

```
scripts/vault-policy-and-role.sh
```

* Seed Vault for admin credentials

```
echo -n '{
  "SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD": "password",
  "SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME": "admin"
}' > admin.json 
```

```
vault kv put sso/vars @admin.json
```

* Seed Vault for provisioning
```
echo -n '{
  "CLIENT_ID": "test-client",
  "CLIENT_SECRET": "xxx",
  "REALM": "rhtr",
  "ROLE_DESCRIPTION": "Editor",
  "ROLE_NAME": "edit",
  "USER_NAME": "user",
  "USER_PASSWORD": "password"
}' > seed.json 
```

```
vault kv put sso/seeder @seed.json
```

* Label namespace for Vault injection

```
oc label namespace $NS vault.hashicorp.com/agent-webhook=enabled
```

## Install

* Seeder job will need to connect to Red Hat SSO API. Red Hat SSO for this part listens on TLS only and its certificates are signed by OpenShift CA Signer. For the seeder to be able to connect, it will need to trust a JKS version of OpenShift CA signer. In this tutorial I will use the [custom-ca-injector](github.com/radudd/custom-ca-injector) for the jks injection. However, this can be also achieved using a binary ConifgMap or an init Container.

```
oc label namespace $NS inject=custom-pki
```

The rest is already prepared, i.e. the job is annotated accordingly and the pem configmap containing the trusted CA is part of the templates.

* Proceed with the installation after customizing `values.yaml`

```
helm install sso helm/redhat-sso
```
